Creation of a simplified version of the pacman game for the ironhack web development bootcamp.

Level 1:
My hero: a colored square(blue?), who start at a fixed position at the beginning.
The enemies: Squares (of another color) appearing randomly on the screen every 3 seconds.
The game ends when the hero is at the same position than one of the monster (improvement for another version: at an adjacent square) , in this case the game ends and the hero has lost the game.
The game is won when the here reaches the central position , symbolised by a square with a 'V'.

Level 2:
Is exactly the same but the monster are appearing more fastly.

Level 3:
3 monsters are appearing near the conter of the board ,everyone at an initial fixed position.
Every monster will move on the same speed.One will start going down, the other goes right and the last goes on top.
How the monsters will move?
They will turn right relatively to their direction , when they are reaching the borders.For instance if a monster goes to the right, he will go down.
If the hero can't turn right, he will turn left.

Level 4:
We create at least one wall (...)
